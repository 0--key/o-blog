= o-blog quick start

This is a sample website to show how to use
https://github.com/renard/o-blog[o-blog].


== Quick start guide
First you need:

- http:www.gnu.org/s/emacs[emacs] (I assume you already have it)
- http://orgmode.org/[org-mode] (same as above)

If you don't have them, you should install them fist.

=== Setup

Start by cloning the +git+ repository from http:github.com[Github].

----
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/renard/o-blog.git
----

And add following to your '~/.emacs.d/init.el' file:

----
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/o-blog")
(require 'o-blog)
----

=== Publish

Open the '~/.emacs.d/o-blog/example/sample.org' file and type 'M-x
org-publish-blog'. The result site would be published by default in
'~/.emacs.d/o-blog/out'.

See the 'example/out/blog/index.html' and 'example/out/todo.html' for more details.
